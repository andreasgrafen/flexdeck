# Flexdeck
**A modern Flexbox touch for [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/)**

Flexdeck is a really simple Userstyle to make the Tweetdeck experience just a tad more coherent (opinionated). The column-container is turned into a flexbox container in which empty space will automatically be taken up by adapting the width of the columns. You can also set a default columns width to avoid them getting too narrow on smaller screens or with a lot of columns selected.
